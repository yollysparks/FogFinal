 * Diclaimer: This is a class that assumes that

 * Imagine a lego with hundreds of the same lego brick.
 * We assume that the price of a single part is 50 kr.
 * This class is neither SOLID nor tested well enough.
 *
 * What is this class supposed to at the end of the project: It will calculate
 * all the need parts, and it will return a list of all of the individula parts
 * their exact number, single and total price(of a batch of the same part),
 * as well the final price of all of them, according to their value in 
 * the database;

    will stay 4.0. And then we cast it to int. We do this, to make sure, that the
    client of the company will get the extra parts, that they will need to "cut"
